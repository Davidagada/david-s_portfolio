### 3MTT Program

These are the projects we have been working on for the 3MTT program

### Project 1
In the real estate market, accurately predicting the price of a house is crucial for both buyers and sellers to make informed decisions. However, the process is often complex due to the multitude of factors that can influence a house's price, such as its size, location, age, and amenities. Traditional methods of price estimation can be time-consuming and may not always capture the nuanced interactions between these factors.

 We developed a model to predict the price of houses given a data with 5000 records including the area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, garage, age, etc

 ### Tools used 
 - Python
 - Pandas
 - Numpy
 - Seaborn
 - Decision Tree Regressor and Linear Regression as our model
